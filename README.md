# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

###Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to use different **Machine Learning Models** to test credit risk and also to evaluate the accuracy of the test. After utilizing different models the results will be compared to each other to determine which model performs the best for the given data set. 

### Background
For this assignment I need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. I will use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, I will oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, I’ll use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, I’ll compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. Once I am done, I’ll evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

### Results:

Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk 





Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
